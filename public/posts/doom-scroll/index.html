        <p>For better or for worse, it’s hard to refute technology’s influence on our culture. Technical innovations in medicine, communication systems, energy, engineering, and AI are just a few fields impacted by tech’s development. In fact, this innovation has been observed to be exponential1. Therefore, significant innovation will occur with higher frequency as current technologies are further developed. However, I believe most innovation seeks to benefit corporations, CEOs, and shareholders at the expense of the people.</p>
<p>An increasingly relevant case of such harm to the people is “doomscrolling”. Adapted from the term “doomsurfing”, doomscrolling is the “excessive time online scrolling through news or other content that makes one feel sad, anxious, angry, etc.”2. Others, including me, broaden the definition to encapsulate the over-consumption of media on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or Twitter (fuck you Elon I’m not calling it X).</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-doom-scroll---a-narrative-of-my-experiences-with-social-medias">Why do I Doom Scroll - A narrative of my experiences with social medias</h2>
<p>Doomscrolling is ever present in the lives of Gen Z. Just last week, YouTube granted me a total of 44 hours and 2 minutes of entertainment. Assuming I’m awake roughly 16 hours a day, I was engrossed by YouTube for 39% of my waking life. Imagine my surprise when the Kindle app only comprised a measly 1.34%. On December 23rd, 2024, I noted, “How do you find enough time in the day? How do people have time to become ‘renaissance people’? Like I want to draw, play music, read, teach, and workout.” It’s clear now where some of that time could come from. What reasoning do I have for doomscrolling at all if it takes up so much time?</p>
<p>It’s easy. It fills the space. Some people on there are funny and make me laugh. There’s useful knowledge about music, art, and video production that I like hearing about. It gives me something to do. I don’t have to talk to people when I don’t want to talk to them. It’s effortless. I get out of my head when I don’t want to think about things. It’s the easiest way to not be bored and I hate being bored. It passes the day quicker. I get a sense of interacting with people without having to put in the social effort to do so.</p>
<p>Looking at my brain dump list of reasons, let’s perform some meta-analysis on myself. I gave 11 reasons why I participate in doomscrolling. In those reasons, my rough categorization of reasons goes as follows: ease of use, disconnect from real world, mimicking social interaction, and knowledge acquisition. The frequency of disconnecting myself from the real world is simultaneously surprising and natural. I’m an introverted person who typically ignores, suppresses, or shames himself for feeling the spectrum of emotions; it’s natural to suppose my phone would be a good candidate for sidestepping expressions of my feelings. It sucks, but my introverted-ness and willingness to beat myself up when interactions don’t go my way is a reason why I use it to mimic social situations. I get to watch social situations instead of interacting with them which keeps me in a comfortable, if at all existing, social bubble.</p>
<p>I have taken steps to shift my consumption towards knowledge acquisition. As mentioned before, I think platforms like YouTube and TikTok COULD be a good resource for learning music, art, videography, physics, philosophy, and more. On YouTube, I’ve recently implemented a system using playlists to categorize similarly themed videos for future use. The key word in that sentence being “use”! This approach to social media platforms aims to support thoughtful consumption with the intent for knowledge in videos to be utilized for future creation.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-my-fault---self-discipline-in-defiance-of-capitalistic-motive">Is it my fault? - Self-discipline in defiance of capitalistic motive</h2>
<p>Older generations often conclude the youth exhibit little self-control when it comes to the use of technologies, especially social media. However, it’s important to consider the structure of social media companies and their goals. Within a capitalistic framework, the duty of corporations is to maximize profits and increase shareholder value. Plain and simple. Without government oversight, which can be imagined quite vividly during the age of robber barons, CEOs would sacrifice babies to volcanoes if it meant a 2% increase in stock price. Looking after the well-being and health of people is antithetical to the mission statement of corpos.</p>
<p>So, how does this apply to social media? Companies such as Twitter and YouTube profit from advertising revenue on content they host on their platforms. Increasing profit comes in two different forms: get companies to pay more for advertising or get people to see more adverts. The former would see other companies losing money and they can’t have that. It’s more worthwhile for social media companies to put hundreds of millions of dollars into R&amp;D on maximizing people’s attention. The general population is not the consumer base for social media companies, it’s advertising companies. And our attention is for sale to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Doomscrolling is an addiction. Overuse of social media is an addiction. Social media profits from our addictive tendency and funds research to monopolize our time.</p>
<p>Is it my fault I doomscroll? I’ll quote Dr. Mike Israetel from his comments on people’s struggle with obesity. “It’s not your fault, but it is your responsibility”3. People should understand it’s our responsibility to limit unhealthy social media. Just know there’s an entire industry ready to make that process as strenuous as possible. Sisyphus has a cushier life than we do.</p>
