I feel a sinking dread whenever I decide to put my phone down and sit with myself. Articulating the experience is challenging. My phone calls to me. It lures me, masterfully occupying my mind with surface-level ideas and quick dopamine hits.

I put the phone down, face down, with a conviction so strong one might've thought the girl from “The Ring” would crawl out. I realize the mistake I've made. The real world feels so dull, almost black and white. Thoughts and ideas previously held captive by the endless scroll are now lethargic. Streams of consciousness are nonexistent. Trains of thought never leave their stations.

I might as well pick up my phone and start scrolling again. It’s calling to me. It’s not like I was thinking anything important anyway.
