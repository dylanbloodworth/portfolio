# ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS

As an aspiring young educator, I aim to help reshape local educational landscapes to serve new generations better. Through my graduate studies at Virginia Tech, I commit to deepening my understanding of educational theory and practice while familiarizing myself intimately with the educational systems I hope to change.

My experiences with peer education and graduate teaching assistantships at Virginia Tech and Washington State University provided a foundational teaching philosophy. I am a co-learner and mentor within a hierarchy of different communities: the classroom, the school, and the local community. I encourage active engagement within these communities. Knowledge generation occurs only when students wrestle with unfamiliar ideas that challenge previously held understandings, producing more complex thoughts and ideas. I encourage students to reflect on their ideas, motivations, and skills as introspection uncovers the deeper trains of thought used when solving real-world problems, leading to further inquiry. Learning doesn't stop when students get 'the right answer'; analysis of these correct answers can be equally rigorous and thought-provoking as problem-solving. Furthermore, the two philosophical pillars above are bolstered further by honest, collaborative dialogue. Collaboration between me and the students seeks to elevate inquiry and discourse as we engage with alternate perspectives and modes of thinking. Honesty and humility within collaborative efforts are crucial; knowing when people lose understanding of ideas is essential to minimize dialogue going over people's heads.

Nelson Mandela asserts that "education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." Mandela succinctly articulates what I expect from my program of study and what I hope to accomplish as an educator. I'm devoted to furthering my pedagogical knowledge to enhance student engagement and reform equitable educational standards at the local community level.

I plan to engage with professors and classmates in formal coursework at Virginia Tech to build a foundation for teaching methods, course development, and assessment strategies, implementing the current understanding of Â­educational research theories. My student teaching placements allow me to construct a holistic perspective on teaching, taking every opportunity to communicate with teachers and administration, practice methods learned in coursework, and seek advice from students about what they think makes a good teacher.

By pursuing a graduate degree at Virginia Tech, I strive to empower the next generation of students with the skills to inspire and enact meaningful change in their communities. As Nelson Mandela said, education is a weapon for change that our communities and country desperately require. Equipping students with critical thinking and reflectivity skills paired with mutual respect and inclusivity allows them to be the agents of change that benefit society for their futures.
